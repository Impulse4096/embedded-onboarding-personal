# Circular Buffer Library

A simple and modular C library for working with circular buffers (ring buffers).  
Implements enqueue/dequeue, size checks, and wraparound handling.  

## Features
- Dynamically allocated circular buffer
- Functions for initialization, cleanup, put (enqueue), get (dequeue)
- Check if buffer is empty or full
- Read multiple items at once
- Lightweight, dependency-free, portable C

├── src/ # Source files (implementation) - actual implementatation of the functions to make the circular buffer library work
├── tests/ # Unit tests - used to test each function in our source file to make sure program run as intended
├── Makefile # Build automation - Automates the build process with a command so you don't have to do it step by step

## Build Instructions
```bash
make        # build the library and tests
make clean  # remove build artifacts
make test   # run unit tests (if defined in Makefile)
make run    # alternative test target
