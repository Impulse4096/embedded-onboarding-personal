# Circular Buffer Library

A simple and modular C library for working with circular buffers (ring buffers).  
Implements enqueue/dequeue, size checks, and wraparound handling.

---

## Features
- Dynamically allocated circular buffer
- Functions for:
  - Initialization and cleanup  
  - Put (enqueue) / Get (dequeue)  
  - Check if buffer is empty or full  
  - Read multiple items at once  
- Lightweight, dependency-free, portable C
